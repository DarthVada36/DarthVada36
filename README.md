# Hello there! ðŸ‘€ 

```javascript
function getWelcomeMessage(name) {
    return `
        Hello, ${name}! ðŸ‘‹
        
        I did this function because I thought it was fun and creative XD
        
        Let me show you my skills and my knowledge ;D
    `;
}

// Call the function and log the message
console.log(getWelcomeMessage("Visitor"));

My journey is anything but ordinary, and I use my diverse experiences to excel professionallyâ€”ideally in the gaming industry ðŸŽ®ðŸ•¹, though Iâ€™m open to exploring other opportunities. You never know what might spark a new passion.

I didnâ€™t always see myself as a programmer. At first, I was hesitant, thinking it wasnâ€™t for me. But as I dove in, I discovered I was quite good at it! My GitHub shows the progress Iâ€™ve made. ðŸ˜‰ While Iâ€™m relatively new to this field, Iâ€™ve embraced it fully, combining my technical skills with my creative background in UI/UX design ðŸŽ¨.

Before this, my career centered around customer service and solving complex challenges efficiently. As part of Player Support, I tackled difficult situations, managed the Player Behavior Area, and gained expertise in ITIL and IT services.

In my role as a Senior Specialized Agent, I went furtherâ€”streamlining processes, mentoring teams, and consistently exceeding KPI goals. Collaborating with regional and global teams taught me the value of effective communication and adaptability.

My experience in gaming extends beyond support roles. Iâ€™ve created workshops and mentoring materials for professional players, as well as social media content for a semi-professional Esports team. These projects let me merge my gaming knowledge with my skills in design and storytelling.

Now, as a Full-Stack Developer, Iâ€™ve added React, Node.js, TypeScript, and SQL to my toolkit, bringing problem-solving expertise and creative thinking to technical challenges. Whether itâ€™s designing intuitive interfaces or optimizing backend systems, I strive to deliver impactful solutions.

Starting over has never been a setback for meâ€”itâ€™s an opportunity. No matter how challenging or unfamiliar the road, Iâ€™m proof that persistence and passion lead to success. ðŸš€
